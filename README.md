- [x] - Score based on size + distance + consecutive hit multiplier
- [x] - Create a proper score "shower"
- [ ] - High score??
- [x] - Show a power bar
- [ ] - Pause button? Maybe?
- [x] - Show ~~scissor lift~~ rocket platform to move up / down

~~
- [ ] - Endless mode (max # of arrows, endless arrows, random arrows, selecting arrows)
- [ ] - 20 puzzles (specified order of arrows? allow people to select arrows?)
- [ ] - 3 stars for time
- [ ] - 3 stars for speed
- [ ] - ????
